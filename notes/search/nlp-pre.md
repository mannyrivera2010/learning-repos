* calculating cosine distance between each document as a measure of similarity
* clustering the documents using the k-means algorithm
* using multidimensional scaling to reduce dimensionality within the corpus
* plotting the clustering output using matplotlib and mpld3
* conducting a hierarchical clustering on the corpus using Ward clustering
* plotting a Ward dendrogram
